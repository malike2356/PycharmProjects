1. Create a folder (vShop) and cd into the fold. Or Create a new project from inside PyCharm with the name vShop.

2. Install Django on into the folder using the terminal. use the following command,
$: pip install django~=3.1.0 

3. Next. run the command

5. It's time to run the python server
$: python3 manage.py runserver

Django is setup successfully. Ready to configure and start building.


NOW LETS ADD SOME MORE APPS TO THE DEFAULT INSTALLATIOIN

1. User the following command to Add new Apps or to existing projects
$: python manage.py startapp products.

2. In the views.py file we import HttpResponse module and use it in a new function.

3. Create a new file called urls.py inside the new package folder and map  the view functions in views.py unto it. For as many view you create, remember to map each function to a line of url pattern

# Example shown below:
# Inside view.py

from django.http import HttpResponse
from django.shortcuts import render


def index(request):
    return HttpResponse("Hello vShop User - Welcome!")


def new(request):
    return HttpResponse("This is is a page for New products")


def categories(request):
    return HttpResponse("This is a Categories Page")


#Inside urls.py

from django.urls import path
from . import views


urlpatterns = [
    path("", views.index),
    path("new", views.new),
    path("categories", views.categories)
]
